| Pattern | Kotlin |
| --- | --- |
| Builder   | `apply` function |
| Decorator | Extension Functions |
| Interpreter | `sealed` classes |
| Iterator | operator functions |
| Observer | observable delegate | 
| Prototype | Data class | 
| Singleton | `object` declaration |
| Strategy | functions |
| Template Method | (top-level) functions |
